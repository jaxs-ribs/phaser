# /scripts

This directory contains various helper and utility scripts for development, maintenance, and operations.

These are scripts that are not part of the main application's runtime but are useful for the development process.

Examples include:
-   `index_repo.py`: A script to perform a one-time indexing of a codebase for the RAG pipeline.
-   `benchmark_rag.py`: A script to measure the performance and token savings of the RAG system.
-   `session_manager.sh`: A `tmux` launcher for managing different development tasks.
