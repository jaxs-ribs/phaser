This module is responsible for applying code changes to the filesystem.

Its primary function is to safely take a unified diff generated by the LLM and patch the corresponding files in the user's workspace.

This is a critical, security-sensitive operation. The implementation must be robust to prevent incorrect or malicious patches from being applied. It will likely wrap the standard `patch` command-line utility.
