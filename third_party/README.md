# /third_party

This directory is for vendored code or assets from other projects.

For example, if we directly use prompt files or scripts from an upstream open-source tool like Aider or Open-Interpreter, we would store them here to keep them separate from our own source code. This makes it easier to track their origins and manage updates.
