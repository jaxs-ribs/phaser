# /tests

This directory contains the full test suite for the project.

Following standard practice, it will house:
-   **Unit Tests**: Testing individual modules and functions in isolation.
-   **Integration Tests**: Testing the interaction between different modules (e.g., ensuring the orchestrator correctly calls the LLM client).
-   **Fixtures & Mocks**: Reusable test data, sample code, and mock objects.

A comprehensive test suite is non-negotiable and is essential for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions, especially given the autonomous nature of the agent. We will aim for high test coverage.
