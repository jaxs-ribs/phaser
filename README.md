# Project X

> **AI-First Coding Assistant**

This repository is an open-source, Gemini-centric replacement for Claude Code, designed for a hands-free, voice-first, "walk-and-code" workflow. It operates autonomously under a strict TDD discipline and is optimized for a low monthly budget.

## Core Philosophy

-   **Voice-First, Hands-Free**: Interact with your codebase while mobile.
-   **Autonomous TDD**: The agent writes code, runs tests, and fixes bugs in a loop without requiring manual approval for every diff.
-   **Aggressive Cost-Optimization**: A combination of local tools (`ripgrep`), advanced context management (`tree-sitter` RAG), and smart prompting aims for a sub-$200/month budget for a heavy user.
-   **Extensible & Unlocked**: A plug-in architecture for LLMs and a self-hosted environment give you full control and prevent vendor lock-in.
